# welcome_to_git

Hello Everyone!

This is a little toy git repo I set up we can play with together.

If you want to try some of the stuff in the tutorial I mailed around before tomorrow, feel free to add or modify files in this project. If you emailed me your github username, you should have received an invitation from github that (when accepted) will give you full privileges to modify files in this repo.
